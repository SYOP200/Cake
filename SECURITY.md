# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Versions of Cake are often supported with security features. The built in features inside `cake.sh` add our policy to our software.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| Pre - 0.2.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

However, like most software, our security is not perfect and we rely on our users to report vulnerabilities before they become issues.

When you report a vulnerability, we ask that you are polite in the Issue or Pull Request description. Use our pre built templates for issues and pull requests, this helps our maintainers better understand the issue.
